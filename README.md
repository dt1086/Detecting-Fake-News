# Detecting Fake News
**Author**: David Tian

## Overview
This project is about detecting fake news, specifically full news articles you (the reader) may come across online. I'll be addressing the issue through analyzing 70,000+ news articles, primarily in the political space, to build a classification model.

### Origin of Fake News
In 2016, Buzzfeed's media editor, Craig Silverman, noticed that a stream of completely made-up stories that seemed to orginate from a small Eastern European town. After investigation, Craig and his colleague discovered that the young people in the town were manufacturing fictional stories to spread on media, in order to cash via Facebook advertising. While the topic of whether these people had an interest in American politics is up for debate, this is seen as the origin of the term "fake news", as we understand it today.<sup>[1](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-42724320)</sup>

### Why is fake news a problem?
According to York College of Pennsylvania:
>Fake news is designed to hit you exactly in the emotions where you are weakest. They'll make you feel something, and from a statistical and psychological perspective that often means that the specific emotion being targeted is anger. That anger tends to spread like a wildfire, makes being neutral very difficult, and paradoxically prevents communication between the various sides of an argument as echo chambers develop to reinforce a side's particular stance on a topic.<sup>[2](https://library.ycp.edu/c.php?g=935163&p=6756543)</sup>

York College of PA continues to define an echo chamber as:
>A closed group of people (including media organizations) who support one another in a particular belief and keep out opposing beliefs.<sup>[2](https://library.ycp.edu/c.php?g=935163&p=6756543)</sup>

The rise of fake news is a problem because it is becoming increasingly difficult to have civil discourse, where different parties can have respectful, back-and-forth conversations with one another due to fake news reinforcing echo chambers and polarizing society as a whole.

### Why did I personally choose this as a project?
Not too long ago, while I was visiting family for the holidays, there was an animated dinner-table discussion where parties could not even agree on the most basic facts. Each party would speak their own truth, presenting news articles/sources that they were most familiar with. As a bystander, I knew that fake news was to blame, since I consider all the parties involved to be logical and well-reasoned individuals.
